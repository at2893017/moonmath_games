	  <h4>Our Mission</h4>
      <p>STEM displicines often times can be daunting, especially if one does not have immediate and easily accessible resources to navigate them. With that in mind, elementary school lays the foundation for a child's education moving forward. Acknowledging the important role of kids within that education level to the future of STEM, we wanted to tailor this website to help them along their own journeys. We hope to encourage kids, especially those from backgrounds that make it difficult to find STEM resources, to explore the wonders in STEM studies all while strengthening a baseline skill, math.</p>
